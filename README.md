# SP23-Immersive-Motivation
This study concerns the relationship between the use of Virtual Reality environments and one's confidence and motivation when completing complex tasks. The prototype used for this study consists of several puzzle rooms that participants will need to figure out how to escape, aided either by a VR headset or by a standard computer screen. Participants will self-report their own feelings of confidence in completing these tasks after completing at least two different puzzles.
This study is written as within-subjects. In order to account for bias, we will split participants into two groups. One group will perform the first puzzle with VR and the second without VR, and the second group will do the same, but with the VR/no VR groups switched.
