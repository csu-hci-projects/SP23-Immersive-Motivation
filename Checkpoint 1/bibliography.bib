abstract="Currently, computer assisted learning and multimedia form a key part of teaching. Interactivity and feedback are valuable in promoting active as opposed to passive learning. The study is conducted as an assessment of the impact of immersive VR on learning gain compared with a non-immersive video capture of VR, with a primary research question focusing on exploring learning gain and a secondary question exploring user experience, whereby understanding this is paramount to recognizing how to achieve a complete and effective learning experience. The study found immersive VR to significantly increase learning gain whilst two key measures of reported experience; enjoyment and concentration, also appeared significantly higher for the immersive VR learners. The study suggests extensive avenues for further research in this growing field, recognizing the need to appeal to a variety of students' learning preferences. For educators, the relevance of self-directed and student-centered learning to enable active learning in the immersive tool is highlighted. Findings of such VR-based studies can be applied across several disciplines, including medical education; providing opportunity for users to learn without real-world consequences of error such as in surgical intervention.",

In VR, users integrate multimodal sensory information they receive to create a unified perception of the virtual world. In this survey, we review the body of work addressing multimodality in VR and its role and benefits in user experience, together with different applications that leverage multimodality in many disciplines. These works thus encompass several fields of research and demonstrate that multimodality plays a fundamental role in VR, enhancing the experience, improving overall performance, and yielding unprecedented abilities in skill and knowledge transfer.},

abstract={The successful development and classroom integration of Virtual (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) learning environments requires competencies and content knowledge with respect to media didactics and the respective technologies. The paper discusses a pedagogical concept specifically aiming at the interdisciplinary education of pre-service teachers in collaboration with human-computer interaction students. The students’ overarching goal is the interdisciplinary realization and integration of VR/AR learning environments in teaching and learning concepts. To assist this approach, we developed a specific tutorial guiding the developmental process. We evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the overall pedagogical concept by analyzing the change in attitudes regarding 1) the use of VR/AR for educational purposes and in competencies and content knowledge regarding 2) media didactics and 3) technology. Our results indicate a significant improvement in the knowledge of media didactics and technology. We further report on four STEM learning environments that have been developed during the seminar.}

abstract = {Background
This teaching project describes the process of creating, implementing, and appraising the use of escape room concepts within a urosepsis high-fidelity simulation scenario.
Method
Instead of a locked room, Breakout EDU locked boxes were incorporated into a clinical simulation. Nursing students applied concepts learned in class and analyzed patient data to obtain clues. These clues helped determine the combination to four locks and progress through the simulation within 60 minutes. After completing the escape room simulation, each group had an opportunity to gather for a team photo, which they posted on social media.
Results
Students reported the escape game contributed to their learning and improved their ability to delegate tasks and work as a team. Preliminary observations reveal that “time” may be a significant factor associated with this teaching strategy.
Conclusion
The concept of an escape room or serious game-based learning was found to be an engaging teaching strategy by faculty and students.}

ABSTRACT = {Virtual Reality is an incipient technology that is proving very useful for training different skills. Our hypothesis is that it is possible to design virtual reality learning activities that can help students to develop their spatial ability. To prove the hypothesis, we have conducted an experiment consisting of training the students using an on-purpose learning activity based on a virtual reality application and assessing the possible improvement of the students&rsquo; spatial ability through a widely accepted spatial visualization test. The learning activity consists of a virtual environment where some simple polyhedral shapes are shown and manipulated by moving, rotating and scaling them. The students participating in the experiment are divided into a control and an experimental group, carrying out the same learning activity with the only difference of the device used for the interaction: a traditional computer with screen, keyboard and mouse for the control group, and virtual reality goggles with a smartphone for the experimental group. To assess the experience, all the students have completed a spatial visualization test twice: just before performing the activities and four weeks later, once all the activities were performed. Specifically, we have used the well-known and widely used Purdue Spatial Visualization Test&mdash;Rotation (PSVT-R), designed to test rotational visualization ability. The results of the test show that there is an improvement in the test results for both groups, but the improvement is significantly higher in the case of the experimental group. The conclusion is that the virtual reality learning activities have shown to improve the spatial ability of the experimental group.},
